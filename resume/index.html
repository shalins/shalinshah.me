  <h2>Sites I Built</h2>
  I began my adventure with computers at age 7, when my dad bought me my first computer. At age 8, I was totally into this basic drag and drop programming environment called <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. When I was 12, I wanted to start to code, so I taught myself the basics of programming by learning HTML and CSS. Since then, I've built a lot of websites and apps, and hacked a lot during my free time. Here are some sites I built:

  <h3>
    <a href="http://www.mittal.net/">Middle School Notes</a>
    <span>2012, 2013</span>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I built this site to reduce the weight of mine, and my friends' backpacks. This is a web app that allows people to study for tests from their phones, laptops, or tablets using well-written and detailed notes on various middle school subjects.</li>
    <li>Made with PHP and JavaScript (Includes HTML and CSS)</li>
  </ul>
