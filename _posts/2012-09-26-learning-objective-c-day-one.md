I have just decided that I should learn my first object-oriented language, Objective-C. Objective-C is for iOS and Mac development and it creates beautiful products. I have a few ideas for apps, but I'm going to learn it first.

I am planning on learning by following some online tutorials. 

## Day one.
I am watching some of the tutorials on <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>. If you visit their site, it is a paid membership, but I emailed them saying I'm a student wanting to learn and I got it free for 6 months (which is loads of time). I am also using the Stanford CS193p course on iTunes-U for some of the fundamentals.
I took less than an hour to go through all of the Hello World stuff. I had made a few demo hello world apps, too. I think that is great for someone (like me) who is a beginner at objective-c.

I also read the apple documentation for objective-c constantly <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action" target="_blank"></a>. To me, the documentation and tutorials they have are absolutely genius! The link to the Stanford CS193p class is <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/blog/15" title="CS193P with Paul Hegarty" target="_blank">here</a>. It is on ios5, though.

Even though I have school every day (except weekends), I will spend at least two hours a day every day (way more on the weekends!) and hopefully learn something awesome by then. :)

Wish me loads of luck!
