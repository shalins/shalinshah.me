<p><a href="/learning-objective-c-day-one/">Obj-C day one experience here</a></p>

Today I learned a ton of stuff done in Objective-C. I learned how to deal with strings, Automatic Reference Counting, Strong qualifiers vs. weak ones like: <code>@property (nonatomic,strong/weak)</code>, instance variables, class variables (not so familiar with these yet...), and the X-Code StoryBoard!

I still haven't even scratched the surface but I think I did pretty good so far! The team treehouse tutorials have helped me the most so far but they don't have everything so I looked in the apple documentation and it's great! I am also spending lots of time on stack overflow but I'm trying to figure things out myself rather than to rely on other people's answers. Also, I have built a simple prediction app where I can ask a question and it randomly generates an answer. It isn't much, but I think I'm grasping the Objective-C syntax although I do think it is a bit rigid.

I am thinking of building a simple but problem-solving project after I get a substancial amount of knowledge on Objective-C so that I can dive right in! I have a few ideas about the app I should build but I'm not sure if the app will be easy or extremely hard to build.
