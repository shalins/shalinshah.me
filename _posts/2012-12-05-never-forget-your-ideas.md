Ok, so a lot of us get all sorts of great ideas that run through our brains every day. So how can you store all of these ideas in your head without forgetting a lot of them? Well, you can use google docs, or notes on the iPhone or even use something like Evernote. But if you get that many ideas, it will get really hard to manage and prioritize (especailly with [everything buckets](http://lifehacker.com/5666954/avoid-everything-buckets-aka-why-i-cant-get-into-apps-like-evernote)). I have always had this problem whenever I think of new ideas. I am too lazy to pull out a peice of paper and write down my ideas. I also don't always have a pen and paper ready (and it's not convenient). But I do have my iPhone. So I built it. I built a simple an app that lets you write your ideas down. 

But wait, aren't there thousands of other apps that do the same. I needed a [vacuum](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012//1107/succeed-with-your-app/) to make this app different. So I sat down and thought, if I was going to use an app like this, then I would probably want it to have some way to prioritize it. I created a simple rating functionality with the iPhone slider so the higher the slider, the greater the rating. The greater the rating, the more it would be at the top. I still had to work a bit on better design. I added some more color and features to it (without making it look ugly) and I got Ideya!

Okay, what the heck is Ideya? Ideya is an app that gives you control and organizes your ideas. Yes, it's that simple. And that is exactly what I wanted it to be - <strong>simple.</strong> That's the beauty of it. The app is completely private so no one can see/steal your ideas (unless they see it on your iPhone). I was going to add a login and register button, but whenever I see that, I feel like it's an obstacle keeping the user from actually using your app. The app can function without it so I didn't include it. I am going to add some better fonts and cleaner UI pretty soon, but I don't want to make it too clucky and slow.

I always remember that if you aim at one thing and become great at it instead of aiming at multiple things and not becoming great at any of them. Ideya serves one purpose but serves it well. I like that.

Ideya is on the [appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ideya/id578536295?mt=8&uo=4)<br>

All in all, Ideya isn't the most innovative product out there, but if you are <strong>constantly</strong> getting new ideas, it's a beautiful app to use. What do you think?
