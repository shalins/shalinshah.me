2012 was the best year of my entire 13 years that I have lived. Here's why:

### Acheivements
+ I learned the basis of programming with 0 knowledge.
+ I built my first website: [Middle School Notes](http://middleschoolnotes.org).
+ I figured out how to [run an EC2 server](/set-up-your-amazon-ec2/) while also learning PHP, MySQL, Linux, Apache, and lots more backend stuff. 
+ I picked up on design and started learning Photoshop.
+ I read books on Objective-C and built an app: [Ideya](http://www.ideyaapp.tk).
+ I went to my first AT&T Hackathon in L.A.
+ I figured out how to solve the Rubik's cube in around 30 seconds.
+ I won an acedemic acheivement award.
+ I got a scholarship to a UCLA programming class

### In 2013
+ I need to finish a whole semester of the CS1B (Computer Science) college class in SaddleBack Valley College.
+ Need to get into the Troy Tech program.
+ I need to learn Ruby and build an awesome Social Network.
+ I need to build at least three new apps.
+ I need to learn at least 3 new programming languages.
+ I need to read **at least** 10 programming books.
+ I need to intern at one startup.
+ I need to finish all my current projects
+ I will run at least 3 days a week

Those are my resolutions and reviews. What's yours?
