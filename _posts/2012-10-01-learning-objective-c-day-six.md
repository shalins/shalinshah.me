### Building App Day 3

Got a ton more stuff done with my app. I have a name for it: Ideya. I figured out how to build a rating system. I have also spent a lot of time on photoshop making the graphics for my app. I am still trying to develop a unique icon for the app.

I will post the icons on the next post I do.

The app still needs a ton of work. It isn't the best turnout, but it will be, once I add the graphics to the actual app.

On the to-do list, still:

Simple sharing buttons using the new iOS 6 Facebook integration and the Twitter integration (twitter integration was released iOS 5).
I still need to add delete buttons for bad ideas.
I need to implement custom UI and graphics
I'll also probably make some money off it (every 10 ideas = 1 dollar?). 
I probably won't add autosave features (maybe).

My goal is to finish Objective-C (or this app) by day 7.
