Do we live in the present? Most people would say "of course" (duh!). But we don't. Here's why.

As time passes, it becomes the past, right? Our brains, although it may feel like it, are not instantaneous, meaning that they take a small fraction of a second to register things. So if you are poked, it would feel instant but it's taking a small amount of time for you to feel it. And since our brain reacts just a little bit slower than time, we live in the past.

So we may not live completely in the past, but we are living in the past by 80 ms.

What do you think?
