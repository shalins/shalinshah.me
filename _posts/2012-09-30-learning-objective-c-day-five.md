### Building App Day 2

I built a lot of stuff in the app. I learned the core data stuff for iOS development and I built a simple version that allows the user to write down their ideas with a simple + (add) sign on the top corner on the main view. The app allows them to save their ideas after writing them. Then, they have a table view with their idea displaying. I also added a simple rating system where the user can rate their idea, but it needs a lot of work to be nearly useful. Before you ask, there are bugs on this app, but its getting there.

It still needs a ton of work. I'll make the rating system efficient, add some facebook and twitter sharing features if the user wants to share their idea (if they have a cooking idea), delete buttons for bad ideas, custom UI, and I'll also probably make some money off it (every 10 ideas = 1 dollar?). I might even add autosave features.
