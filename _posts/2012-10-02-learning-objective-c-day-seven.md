Woohoo! Ideya is now done! Well, at least for now, it is funtional and it looks pretty good, too.

<b>Today I accomplished:</b>

An awesome icon to go with the app!
A creation date
A email share button
A lot of bug fixes.
A BUNCH of more polished UI (not perfect - I only spent one hour designing everything).

That's it really. It probably took me less than ten total hours spent on the actual app, and definitely less than twenty-four hours including actually learning Objective-C from scratch. Not too bad.

I'll write about it soon (maybe in a month) after the app goes on the app store
