## <br />Not All Hacking Is <strong>BAD.</strong>
First of all, it is a mentality built by people that hacking is bad. And I disagree. Hacking someone's personal information and stealing their identity or doing damage or destructive things is bad. But not all hacker do that, especially not me.

<blockquote>Hacking is the practice of modifying the features of a system, in order to accomplish a goal outside of the creator's original purpose. The person who is consistently engaging in hacking activities, and has accepted hacking as a lifestyle and philosophy of their choice, is called a hacker.

Computer hacking is the most popular form of hacking nowadays, especially in the field of computer security, but hacking exists in many other forms, such as phone hacking, brain hacking, etc. and it's not limited to either of them.

Due to the mass attention given to blackhat hackers from the media, the whole hacking term is often mistaken for any security related cyber crime. This damages the reputation of all hackers, and is very cruel and unfair to the law abiding ones of them, from who the term itself originated.</blockquote>

## The Hacking I Do

Okay, so I don't like hacking things for destructive purposes. But I love hacking. Somethings I like to hack are iPods (okay, not really hacking, jailbreaking), servers (just to make things simpler), browser (using simple JavaScript hacks), apps (iOS), web languages (CSS, JS, Ruby, etc.), I hack all day-to-day used objects and stuff... (from how I tie my shoes to hacking computer stuff). Hackers are not just for protecting computers or destroying them. They tweak things for and mod them for their own benefits (finding loopholes).

So just cause I like to hack, I am not a bad guy. And I'm not saying that there aren't bad hackers, it's that not all of them are bad, and shouldn't be judged as bad either.

Still think hacking is bad? <a href="http://lifehacker.com" target="_blank">This</a> should change your mind! :)
