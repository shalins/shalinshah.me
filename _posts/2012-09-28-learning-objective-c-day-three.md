Learned a lot of new stuff in Obj-C like Web-Views (inserting html, loading a html or pdf page, or loading an actual website) and making a Safari type application with forward and back buttons.

I have been watching a lot of videos and doing a lot of quizes and homework they give.
One really good thing about TeamTreehouse is that it makes you pass all of your quizes before they let you move on, so if you don't pass, you either have to rewatch the video (the stuff they  ask on the quiz/test is always in the video) or post in their forums. But the quizes are easy. Another good thing is that their videos are only like 7 minutes long (they have a lot of videos, though) so I don't fall asleep (the stanford cs193p videos I watch are like 1 hr plus per video).

By the way, I didn't pay for TeamTreehouse. I just emailed them saying I wanted to learn and they gave me 6 months free for everything (the normal price is like $9.00/mo.!!!)

This is what I plan on learning next:

1. More about Web Views
2. Core Data
3. Notifications

I am still thinking of ideas on an app that I can make and aren't too complex.
