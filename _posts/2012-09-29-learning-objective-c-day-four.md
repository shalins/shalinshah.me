I built a replica of the safari app that is in all the iOS devices using webViews. My app has simple back and forward buttons and a google page where you can search. It's a really simple version of mobile Safari.

I also finally thought of a project I want to build that is simple enough but is useful. I am going to take screenshots of it as I progress. I will post the link after I am done. 

## The App.
How many times have you had an idea that is great but you forget? I do a lot. The app is where you can write down all you ideas before you forget them. Ranging from an idea about a recipe to a super-genius invention idea. Whatever it is, you won't forget, because now you have this app! I still have to learn along the way. I have to learn about Core Data and a bunch of UI (user interface) stuff before it is fully done, but I will just make a functional version first. 

The project itself isn't very hard, but I still have to learn.
Check back soon for more about my experience on how this project goes (if I successfully make it, or it miserably fails).
